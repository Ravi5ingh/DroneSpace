<h1>De-Centralized Model for Drone Traffic</h1>
<p>This is the code for a Repast simulation of a agent based model for drone traffic management. There is no centralized visibility and the drones must communicate with each other in order to navigate to their destinations without collision</p>
<h2>The Simulation</h2>
<p>When the simulation is running, it starts off with a cubic space with some landing stations at the floor marked in blue. Drones are initially suspended at random points within the space. Once the simulation is initialized, they achieve a flight altitude and commence navigation towards a random landing station. They repeat this indefinitely, moving from one station to the next randomly. The following link will show an example run of the simulation:</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The design is basically like really awesome.</p>
